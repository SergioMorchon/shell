# Shell

A prototype for a mobile / desktop shell component, aiming to:

- Let the navigation bar on the left side for a desktop viewport, and fixed to the bottom for a mobile viewport.
- Keep the main content with its own scroll.

Also some other experimental components and hooks, such as:

- `useDialog`
- `Carousel`
- `Stack` and `Inline`

Take a look at [src/app.tsx](./src/app.tsx).
